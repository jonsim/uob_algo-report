\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
Rupert

An automated trader is an algorithm that automatically places trading orders on
an electronic market.
The trader receives buy or sell orders from customers with a price and
quantity.
The trader makes money by buying for less than the customers price or selling
for more than the customers price.
Therefore the goal of a trading strategy is maximise these margins and the
trading volume to maximise the amount of profit.

In a double auction buyers submit bids to the market and sellers submit asks.
When a bid equals or exceeds a seller's asks the bid is accepted and the trade
occurs. Experiments have shown (Smith 1962) that the prices in the market will
rapidly converge on the price equilibrium in a number of market environments.

IBM published a paper in 2001 that showed that their MGD trading strategy and
Dave Cliff's ZIP were able to outperform human traders.
Algorithmic strategies are able to react more quickly to changing market
conditions and combine information from a multiple sources.

In this paper we experiment with different trading strategies for the
continuous double auction.
We have implemented the Adaptive Aggressiveness trading algorithm and compared
its performance with other adaptive algorithms as well as simpler traders.

\section{Environment} \label{sec:environment}
\subsection{BSE} \label{sec:BSE}
For this assignment we use the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) as a virtual trading environment or, 
more accurately, a minimal simulation of a limit order book financial exchange. As it is 
minimalistic it has the advantage of being both easy to understand and quick to run.

BSE acts like a dark pool continuous double auction as both buyers and sellers simultaneously bid 
towards their limit price and can see all other offers but do not know the identity of the trader.
Only a single commodity is traded. 
This has a number of implications, the main one being the difficulty of implementing the MGD trader 
in this environment as it requires non-anonymised data to calculate which trades have been updated 
each time step. This is covered in more detail in Section \ref{sec:traders_GDV}.

\subsubsection{GD-Variants} \label{sec:traders_GDV}
Rupert

The Gjerstad Dickhaut (GD) trading strategy was invented by John Dickhaut and
Steven Gjerstad in their 1998 paper \emph{Price Formation in Double Auctions}.
GD works by building a belief function of whether a bid at a particular price
will be accepted by a seller.
The buyer then aims to maximise their profit thorugh a combination of margin
and chance of trading.
The belief values are formed based on observed trades and outstanding shouts.
The GD strategy makes some simple assumptions such as if a bid was rejected a
lower bid will also be rejected since it will be less attractive to a seller.
The results of the experiments showed that GD has a higher efficiency than ZI.
The efficiency is the margin divided by the maximum theoreticaly margin
(difference between limit and price equilibrium).
They also showed that GD was able to cope with chaning supply and demand
conditions.

Modified Gjerstad Dickhaut (MGD) (Tesauro, Das, IBM)  is a version of GD that
is better suited to volatile conditions that can occur at the start of a
session where there is very little information about accepted and rejected
orders.
An MGD agent remembers the highest and lowest prices from the last session.
A MGD buyer will then set the belief function to 1 for all prices above the
lowest price and to 0 for all prices below the lowest price.
MGD is also able to hold multiple units.

GDX is a Dynamic Programming based variant of GD.
GDX uses the same belief function as GD but uses Dynamic Programming to
maximise the long term reward instead of the short term reward.
Dynamic Programming is used to compute optimal policies in Markov Decision
Problems.
The emphasis placed between short and long term rewards can be controlled using
the discount value ($\gamma$).
$\gamma = 0$ will result in the same behaviour as the standard GD strategy
(short-term reward) while $\gamma = 1$ will cause GDX to maximise the long term
reward.
However setting $\gamma$ close to 1 will cause GDX to always wait for a better
deal and thus not make any trades.
They found that under certain market environments GDX was able to outperform
both GD and ZIP.
With a $\gamma$ between 0.75 and 0.85 GDX always outperforms GD.
GDX is more flexible than GD and can handle multiple goods although
optimisations are needed to keep the state space tractable.

1993).

\subsection{Adaptive Aggressive Traders} \label{sec:AA}
The adaptive aggressive algorithm relies on the principal that you can be in
two different states. One where you trade more frequently closer to your limit
price, higher chance of trading but lower profit per trade. The other where you
trade further from your limit price, which decreases the liklihood fo making a
trade but increases the amount of profit you will make when you do trade.

The Adaptive-Aggressive algorithm maintains an aggressiveness value (r), which
determines how close to your limit price you will be trading. A completely
aggressive buyer ($r = 1$) will buy at their limit price, and a completely
passive trader ($r = -1$) will buy at the minimum market price (\$1 in our case)

\subsubsection{Price estimation} \label{sec:AA_price_estimation}
Short term learning reflects how the value of our aggressive is calculated and
then subsequently updated. However, first we must define two concepts. An
intra-marginal trader is a trader that bids above the equilibrium if they are a
buyer (or asks below the equilibrium if they are a seller). Whereas an
extra-marginal trader will never trade above the equilibrium if they are a
buyer (or below the equilibrium if they are a seller).

Whether our trader is acting in an extra-marginal or intra-marginal capacity
will depend upon the limit price for our order. If we have a limit price above
the equilibrium (below the equilibrium for a seller) then we are considered an
intra-marginal trader otherwise we are considered extra-marginal.

The price that we then submit will depend upon which capacity we are acting
under based on the follow equations.

\textbf{Intra-marginal buyer}

$\tau =
\begin{cases}
      \hat{p}^*(1- \frac{e^{-r\theta}-1}{e^{\theta}-1}), &  \text{if r } \in (-1,0)  \\
      \hat{p}^* + (l_i-\hat{p}^*)(\frac{e^{r\theta}-1}{e^\theta-1}), & \text{if
      r } \in (0,1)
\end{cases}$

where $\theta$ (REFERENCE) measures the volatility of the
market, $l_i$ is the limit price for the buyer, $\hat{p}^*$ is the estimator of the
equilibrium price.

\textbf{Extra-marginal buyer}

$\tau =
\begin{cases}
      l_i(1-\frac{e^{-r\theta}-1}{e^\theta-1} &  \text{if r } \in (-1,0)  \\
      l_i & \text{if
      r } \in (0,1)
\end{cases}$

\textbf{Intra-marginal seller}

$\tau =
\begin{cases}
      \hat{p}^* + (MAX-\hat{p}^*)( \frac{e^{-r\theta}-1}{e^{\theta}-1}), &  \text{if r } \in (-1,0)  \\
      c_j + (\hat{p}^*-c_j)(1-\frac{e^{r\theta}-1}{e^\theta-1}), & \text{if
      r } \in (0,1)
\end{cases}$

where MAX is the maximum value that can be submitted to the market and $c_j$ is
te limit price for the seller.

\textbf{Extra-marginal seller}

$\tau =
\begin{cases}
      c_j + (MAX-c_j)(1-\frac{e^{-r\theta}-1}{e^\theta-1} &  \text{if r } \in (-1,0)  \\
      c_j & \text{if r } \in (0,1)
\end{cases}$

\subsubsection{Short term learning} \label{sec:AA_short_term_learning}
Once we decided what capacity we are acting in we then use the following
equations to calculate our aggressiveness

$r(t+1) = r(t) + \beta_1(\delta(t) - r(t))\\\delta(t) = (1 \pm
\lambda_r)r_{shout} \pm \lambda_a$
